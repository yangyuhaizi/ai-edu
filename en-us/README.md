<h1 align="center">Microsoft AI Education Community</h1>

Microsoft AI Education Community, AI-Edu, is an open source AI community created by AI education team of Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA).
  
This community is composed of three modules: **Basic Tutorials**, **Practical Cases**, and **Practical Projects**. Readers are guided through systematic theoretical tutorials and applicable and diverse practical cases. This aides in the learning and mastery of artificial intelligence knowledge, and exercising their development abilities in actual projects.

## **Mission**
Under the guidance of the Ministry of Education, relying on the new generation of artificial intelligence, open scientific research, and education platforms, the R&D team of Microsoft Research Asia and the Academic Cooperation Department will provide comprehensive support for this community. We will provide real cases of artificial intelligence application development, supporting tutorials, tools, as well as other learning resources. First-line teachers and learners in the field of artificial intelligence will also share their resources and experience.

As pointed out in Microsoft’s mission "to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more", we look forward to the establishment of this open source community to learn and contribute together with teachers, students, and developers. Improving this community will contribute to the development of artificial intelligence in China.
